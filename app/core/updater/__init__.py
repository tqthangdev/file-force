"""Updater: check GitHub Releases, download, verify and stage a new build.

The running app never overwrites itself — it prepares a package under
``.update/<version>/`` and hands the swap to a separate updater process
(``apply.py``). The GUI only talks to this package, never to the GitHub API
directly.
